# MEAN
The mean (average) of a data set is found by adding all numbers in the data set and then dividing by the number of values in the set. 

# MEDIAN
The median is the middle value when a data set is ordered from least to greatest. 

# MODE
The mode is the number that occurs most often in a data set. 

# STANDARD DEVIATION
Standard deviation measures the spread of a data distribution. 

It measures the typical distance between each data point and the mean.


The formula we use for standard deviation depends on whether the data is being considered a population of its own, or the data is a sample representing a larger population.


If the data is being considered a population on its own, we divide by the number of data points, 

If the data is a sample from a larger population, we divide by one fewer than the number of data points in the sample.

# Sample Variance
Sample variance is used to measure the spread of the data points in a given data set around the mean. 

All observations of a group are known as the population. 

When the number of observations start increasing it becomes difficult to calculate the variance of the population. 

In such a situation, a certain number of observations are picked out that can be used to describe the entire group. 
This specific set of observations form a sample and the variance so calculated is the sample variance.

# Confidence Interval: Sample Mean
To construct a confidence interval for a sample mean, we need to know the variability of the sample mean. 

This means we need to know how to compute the standard deviation or the standard error of the sampling distribution.

# Z - SCORE
A z-score measures exactly how many standard deviations above or below the mean a data point is.
